\section{Results}

To demonstrate the effectiveness of the nested iterative algorithm, we utilize both analytical closed form functionals and real world data in both 1-D and 2-D. A list of the problems tested is given below.

% Explain about the common problem datasets that we are going to be using and why they have been chosen.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Synthetic data: sinc($x$)=$\frac{sin(x)}{x}$ functional on $\Omega \in [-4, 4]$
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 1-D: Q = (sinc($x$) + sinc(2*$x$-1) + sinc(3*$x$+1.5)), 
		\item 2-D: Q = (sinc($\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$))
	\end{itemize}
	\item S3D: This is a 3-D turbulent combustion dataset generated by an S3D simulation \cite{chen-s3d-2009} of fuel jet combustion in the presence of an external cross-flow. 
	\item Nek5000: A 3-D dataset from CFD simulation with velocity magnitude 
	\item CESM: A 2-D Community Atmosphere Model climate model dataset on a sphere with 3600x1800 resolution
\end{enumerate}



\subsection{1-d Results}\label{AA}

Problem setups
\begin{itemize}
  \item Sine
  \item Sinc
  \item S3D
  \item Dow-Jones historical daily data
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Use the first two problems to measure convergence in parallel as number of domains increase
	\item Talk about adaptivity and resolution of data even for highly varying problem data.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{2-d Results}

Problem setups
\begin{itemize}
	\item Sinc
	\item Nek5000
	\item S3D
	\item CESM data
\end{itemize}


\begin{itemize}
	\item Adaptive algorithms to resolve data and provide compression
	\item DD scheme with ASM in combination with adaptivity.
	\item Discuss about complications and potential ways to enforce continuity. (a) Use decoded data, (b) Use control point space across interface
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Parallel Scalability}\label{SCM}


Bebop cluster at
Argonne National Laboratory LCRC (Laboratory Computing
Resource Center). Bebop has 1024 public nodes, with Intel
Broadwell or Intel Knights Landing processors, with 128 GB
memory per Broadwell node, and 104 GB per KNL node. It
has an Omni-Path Fabric Interconnect. Broadwell processors
have 36 cores, while KNL processors have 64 cores. We used
Broadwell processors for these tests.


Showcase some scalability results on Bebop for the 2-d problem; Take S3D and CESM datasets, along with artificial sinc combination functions.

How does the nearest neighbor communication stay bounded ?
