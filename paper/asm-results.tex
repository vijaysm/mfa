\label{sec:results}

To demonstrate the effectiveness of the nested iterative algorithm, we utilize both analytical closed form functionals and scientific datasets in both 1-D and 2-D obtained from high-fidelity simulations. A brief description of the problem cases that are used as test datasets are given below.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Synthetic data: sinc($x$)=$\frac{sin(x)}{x}$ functional on $\Omega \in [-4, 4]$
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 1-D: Q = (sinc($x$) + sinc(2*$x$-1) + sinc(3*$x$+1.5)), 
		\item 2-D: Q = (sinc($\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$))
	\end{itemize}
%	\item Nek5000: A 3-D dataset from CFD simulation with velocity magnitude as the solution profile
	\item S3D: This is a 3-D turbulent combustion dataset generated by an S3D simulation \cite{chen-s3d-2009} of fuel jet combustion in the presence of an external cross-flow. 
	\item CESM: A 2-D Community Atmosphere Model climate model dataset on a sphere with 3600x1800 resolution
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Adaptive Error Convergence and Verification}

The 1-D implementation of the ASM iterative solver was applied to the sinc problem. An initial input problem size of 500 points was evaluated as a test case, and MFA representation for the resulting profile was computed on 4 subdomains. The solution profile, along with the control point locations from the adaptive computation are shown in \fig{fig:sinc-adaptive-a}. We utilized the residual definition shown in \eqt{eq:nonlinear-residuals} with a $G_1$ constraint to be satisfied along all internal subdomain interfaces. The \fig{fig:sinc-adaptive-b} and \fig{fig:sinc-adaptive-c} present the zoomed in reconstruction of the approximation near the interface between $\Omega_2$ and $\Omega_3$ before, and after the ASM iterations are converged. The discontinuous representation of data when performing independent, adaptive, unconstrained subdomain solves are converged to satisfy the constraints after only 3 RAS iterations, with nearest neighbor exchange of control point data at the interfaces to recover $G_1$ continuity.

\subsubsection{Overlap Experiments in 1-D}

In this 1-D experiment on the closed form sinc function shown in \sect{sec:results}, we utilize the decoded residual minimization with the ASM-Krylov solver combination, and increase the amount of overlap in the input points to look at convergence speed. We measured the global $L_2$ error convergence along with the total cost in terms of outer iteration to compute the constrained control point locations. In this analysis, adaptivity in the individual subdomains was explicitly turned off so as to maintain a constant ratio of input points to control points per subdomain, as overlap region is extended in the subdomains on both the left and right sides.

\fig{fig:decoded-overlap-data-performance} shows the global $L_2$ norm of the net error in the decoded residual, as the number of subdomains are increased. With no overlap regions, where only the interface data is shared, the total ASM iterations needed to satisfy convergence, and the net error increase monotonically with $n_s$. As the overlap size becomes larger, for $\Delta=32$ and $\Delta=64$, the error growth and the iterations required remain much more bounded in comparison to the non-overlapping case. The implications of this particular result closely matches the DD ASM preconditioning theory often applied in PDE solvers \cite{smith-ddm, lions-asm, gander-rasm}. It also shows that the RAS iterative scheme can be accelerated more efficiently, and scalably used as a solver without a prohibitive linear complexity of O($n_s$).

\subsection{2-D Results}

We utilize the described 2-D problem datasets to better understand the convergence and parallel scalability of the proposed algorithms at scale. Demonstrations for the S3D, Nek5000 and Climate datasets are provided below.

\subsubsection{S3D dataset}
Using the varying fidelity of the real world data, and the ability to create complex closed form functionals within our Python implementation, the approach was verification for accuracy using uniform control point refinements to yield sizes theoretical convergence orders. Additionally, using adaptive resolution based on a-posteriori gradient estimates, numerical errors in strongly varying solution profiles were reduced to within user-specified tolerances. A sample solution for the 2-D slice of the S3D dataset on 9 subdomains is shown in \fig{fig:s3d-adaptive-2d}, along with the error convergence at the first iteration and on convergence of the RAS iterations.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\subfloat[S3D dataset profile\label{fig:s3d-adaptive-2d-a}]{%
	\includegraphics[width=0.44\textwidth]{figures/s3d-2d-profile.png}}

	\caption{2-D slice of the S3D dataset: profile and adaptive error resolution with tolerance=$10^{-2}$}
	\label{fig:s3d-adaptive-2d}
\end{figure}

The errors in the decoupled LSQ solve shown in \fig{fig:s3d-adaptive-2d-b} has relatively larger errors in the subdomains with strong gradient changes. When including knot adaptivity combined with RAS iterative scheme, the errors in the reconstructed MFA data are reduced to within user-specified relative tolerances of $10^{-2}$. This result demonstrates the convergence of the proposed scheme to adaptively resolve a complex scientific solution profile, even on a small number of subdomains ($n_s=16$).

\subsection{Parallel Scalability}\label{sec:parallel-scalability}

The parallel scalability of the implemented RAS iterative solver for ensuring continuity across block boundaries was measured on the 2-D CESM dataset, whose solution profile in a uniform latitude-longitude grid is shown in \fig{fig:cesm-2d-profile}. 
Our experiments were executed on the Bebop cluster at
Argonne National Laboratory LCRC (Laboratory Computing Resource Center). Bebop has 1024 public nodes, with Intel Broadwell or Intel Knights Landing processors, with 128 GB memory per Broadwell node, and 104 GB per KNL node. It has an Omni-Path Fabric Interconnect. Broadwell processors have 36 cores, while KNL processors have 64 cores. We primarily used the KNL processors for the scalability tests presented below.

A strong scalability test was performed on the Bebop cluster with the climate dataset, using 32 subdomains in X-direction and 128 subdomains in Y-direction. With this fixed DD and 100 control point per subdomain resolution, the driver utilized DIY to handle the block assignment to processes. As the total number of processes used in the parallel run was varied from [1,2,$\ldots$4096], we measured the overall time for the initial subdomain solves, and the consequent RAS iteration cycle for $nMaxASM=5$. The time to compute the MFA in parallel is shown for this strong scalability experiement in \fig{fig:cesm-strong-scalability}.

\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{figures/cesm-profile.png}
	\caption{2-D CESM climate dataset}
	\label{fig:cesm-2d-profile]}
\end{figure}

As expected, the hierarchical iterative scheme with RAS-Krylov combination shows excellent scalability for the chosen dataset and the overall time to compute the MFA was reduced from nearly 7000s on a single process,  to 9.5s on 2048 processes, while ensuring $G_0, G_1$ continuity in the domain interfaces. The ratio of computational work in local subdomain solves in comparison to communication time in nearest-neighbor exchanges gradually increases as subdomain size shrinks. This is due to the fact that global information on smaller subdomains take multiple iterations to propagate, and hence using overlaps for such large problems would be a recommended extension in the future to improve overall scalability of the algorithm.

\Remark{should we try to do a small performance profile benchmark
	communication: C = 4096*4 = 16384 messages
	serial = 5C + 5A
	parallel = 5C + 5A/p
